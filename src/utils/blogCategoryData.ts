    Technology: `
    Subject & Composition
    Focus on a modern, sleek tech aesthetic. Use abstract representations of code, circuits, or digital networks.
    
    Visual Elements
    Include recognized tech logos or icons (React, AI, Cloud) but stylized to fit a coherent theme (e.g., glassmorphism, neon outlines). Use screenshots or code snippets if relevant, ensuring they are simplified for small sizes.
    
    Color & Mood
    Dark theme aesthetic is preferred: deep blues, purples, and blacks with bright neon accents (cyan, magenta, electric green). maintain a "clean" and "futuristic" vibe.
    
    Typography
    Use monospace or modern sans-serif fonts. Keep text minimal—just the main concept or a catchy title (e.g., "NextJS 14", "AI Revolution").

    Positioning
    Title should be bold large and at the top of the thumbnail
    `,

    opinion: `
    Subject & Composition
    Use a split composition or a strong central conceptual image that represents the conflict or point of view. If the author is famous, a thoughtful portrait works; otherwise, use metaphorical imagery (e.g., a path diverging, a scale balancing).
    
    Visual Elements
    Use visual metaphors. For example, if discussing "AI vs Humans", show a robotic hand shaking a human hand or a chess piece.
    
    Color & Mood
    Use high contrast to suggest strong opinions. Black and white with a single strong accent color (like red or yellow) works well to highlight the "hot take".
    
    Typography
    Bold, serif fonts for a serious, editorial look (like a newspaper or magazine headliner). Use quotes if applicable near the title.

    Positioning
    Title should be bold large and at the top of the thumbnail
    `,

    listicle: `
    Subject & Composition
    Organized and structured layout. A grid or a split screen showing 2-3 examples of the items listed. A large number is essential (e.g., "7", "Top 10").
    
    Visual Elements
    Use icons or small illustrations to represent the list items. A checklist graphic or a visible "stack" of items helps convey value.
    
    Color & Mood
    Bright and energetic but organized. Use distinct blocks of color to separate the text/number from the images. White backgrounds with colorful playful elements often work well.
    
    Typography
    The number should be the biggest element. Use clean, bold sans-serif fonts. "Top X", "Best of", "Guide" should be clearly readable.

    news: `
    Subject & Composition
    Broadcast style. A relevant image of the subject (e.g., a company logo, a person in the news, a device) with a "Breaking News" or "Update" overlay style.
    
    Visual Elements
    Use graphical overlays like lower-thirds or banners. Backgrounds can include subtle world maps, newspaper textures, or abstract "data streams".
    
    Color & Mood
    Urgent colors: Red, White, and Black, or deep Navy Blue. High contrast to grab attention immediately.
    
    Typography
    Heavy, impact-style fonts. All caps for the main headline. Keep it short: "UPDATE", "RELEASED", "ALERT".

    Positioning
    Title should be bold large and at the top of the thumbnail

    review: `
    Subject & Composition
    Product-focused. The product should be the hero, well-lit and center stage. If it's a software, a clean screenshot of the dashboard.
    
    Visual Elements
    Include rating elements like stars (4/5), checkmarks vs crosses, or a "Pros vs Cons" visual cue. A "Recommended" or "Editor's Choice" badge adds authority.
    
    Color & Mood
    Trustworthy colors: Blues, Greens (for positive), or crisp White backgrounds. avoid overly chaotic colors; keep it clean and professional.
    
    Typography
    Clear, readable title of the product. Optional: A short verdict word like "Worth it?", "Best Buy", "Avoid".

    story: `
    Subject & Composition
    Narrative and emotional. Use an illustration or a customized photo that captures a specific moment or feeling. Avoid looking like a stock photo; it should feel personal.
    
    Visual Elements
    Soft textures, watercolor effects, or sketch-like outlines. If it's a travel story, a scenic shot; if personal growth, a symbolic climb or light at end of tunnel.
    
    Color & Mood
    Warm, organic tones (earthy browns, oranges, soft greens) or moody atmospheric lighting depending on the story type.
    
    Typography
    Handwritten or serif fonts to evoke a human touch. Keep text minimal to let the image tell the story.
